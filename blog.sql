It is also called as "All India War Memorial" located astride Rajpath and its view is as that of an arch standing erect in all its glory. All along its stature, the gate bears the beautifully carved names of 82,000 soldiers who sacrificed their lives and the place whispers the aura of their gallantry.

It nearly served for about 200 years as a main residence for the emperor of the Mughal dynasty and as the ceremonial and political centre of the Mughal state. The enormous building reflects a fusion of Timurid and Persian traditions. The Red Fort is the largest monument in Delhi and its importance is such that the Prime Minister of India hoists the tricoloured flag at the foremost entry of the fort.

One of us was comfortable as she did it before, two had never done skating. I ,on the other hand, used to skate as a child, so was totally confused & excited at the same time.

Some slipping, some trying to support others and a few being victim of the falling ones in search of support. Tired of walking in the chain and after getting a little confident of the slipperiness, my childhood instincts kicked in and I decided to let go off the railing. Started with small movements, trying my best not to fall and yeah I completed my first round without any help. Cautious of not to have that same grin I went to my friends, caught hold of them & started skating in the middle, one slide at a time.

When in the worst mood ever, life sucks & it gets difficult to take a single step forward. Dragging yourself you ask you mom ''Khane mein kya hai?'' & your ears get the golden words ''Rajma chawal''. Who''s up & kicking, oh that''s you.\n</p>\n<br><div class="row"><img class="img-responsive col-xs-12 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1 col-lg-10 col-lg-offset-1" src="img/rajma3.jpg" alt="">\n                    </div>\n<p>\n2.

When your mother is trying to convince you for a rishta & hit you with her best stroke i.e. rajma chawal.\n</p><br>\n<p>\n6. When you know there is Rajma Chawal for dinner at home &you skip meals so that you can pounce on the plate like a hungry tiger.\n</p>\n<br>\n<p>\n7. When your parents are screaming at you about something, but all you can think is ''tomorrow''s a good day for rajma chawal'' \n</p>\n<br>\n<p>\n8.

Which one do you choose? Here are the food items that you should definitely include in your everyday meals!\r\n</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h2 class="section-heading">Lemons</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n<br>\r\nHow to consume them?\r\n<br>\r\nLemons can add an amazing flavor to a couple of things, rice for instance can be cooked very well with lemon. Alternatively, you can add it to your green tea or have it \r\nwith a mix of hot water and honey.\r\n<br>\r\nWhy Lemon?\r\n<br>\r\nOne lemon a day fulfills a person&#39;s 100 percent vitamin C needs. It has been speculated that they can prevent cancer by slowing the growth of certain cells. They&#39;re also widely \r\nknown for their anti-oxidant properties.\r\n</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<div class="row"><img class="img-responsive col-xs-12 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1 col-lg-10 col-lg-offset-1" src="img/hd5.jpg" alt="">\r\n                    </div>\r\n                    \r\n                    <span class="caption text-muted">Lemons</span>\r\n<br>\r\n<h2 class="section-heading">Broccoli</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n<br>\r\nHow to consume it?</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>\r\nIt definitely isn''t a favorite food item, especially among children. Some interesting ways to include it in your meals are to cook it with rice, mixed vegetables or even as a pizza topping!\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nWhy Broccoli?\r\n<br>\r\nIt is rich in Vitamin K, B1, B2, B6, B9, Amino Acid, Sodium, Potassium and is known to have more Vitamin E than olive oil. Basically itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s really healthy!\r\n</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<div class="row"><img class="img-responsive col-xs-12 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1 col-lg-10 col-lg-offset-1" src="img/hd1.jpg" alt="">\r\n                    </div>\r\n                    \r\n                    <span class="caption text-muted">Broccoli</span>\r\n<br>\r\n<h2 class="section-heading">Dark Chocolate</h2>\r\n<p><br>\r\nHow to consume it?\r\n<br>\r\nWell, unwrap the bar and eat it! But be careful not to eat too much at a time. Have a cube with a glass of milk. Use it to sweeten or flavor the milk.\r\n<br?\r\n\r\nWhy Dark Chocolate?\r\n<br>\r\nIt is a lesser known fact that dark chocolate is good for your heart. It is rich in antioxidants and flavonoids. It also helps in keeping a check on the blood pressure & stubborn cholesterol.\r\n\r\n\r\n</p><br>\r\n<div class="row"><img class="img-responsive col-xs-12 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1 col-lg-10 col-lg-offset-1" src="img/hd4.jpg" alt="">\r\n                    </div>\r\n                    \r\n                    <span class="caption text-muted">Dark Chocolate</span>\r\n<br>\r\n<h2 class="section-heading">Potato (Surprise! Surprise!)\r\n\r\n</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n<br>\r\nHow to consume them?\r\n<br>\r\nWell, obviously not as chips from the packet. In fact potatoes in any packaged form will not bring you any benefits. Boiled potatoes in salads, or as hash browns or even as fries are the way to go!\r\nBaked potatoes taste good too!\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nWhy Potatoes? \r\n<br>\r\nPotatoes contain cell building folates, fight cancerous cells and help in making the immune system strong! \r\nThey also contain good carbs!\r\n<br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class="row"><img class="img-responsive col-xs-12 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1 col-lg-10 col-lg-offset-1" src="img/hd2.jpg" alt="">\r\n                    </div>\r\n                    \r\n                    <span class="caption text-muted">Potatoes</span>\r\n<h2 class="section-heading">Walnuts</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nHow to consume them?\r\n<br>\r\nEat it as it is. Garnish your oats with walnuts, bake them with cakes and bread or soak them in milk!\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nWhy walnuts?\r\n<br>\r\nThey contain Omega-3 Fatty Acids which are known to assist in maintaining cholesterol levels.\r\nThey may even prevent us from damage against the sun!\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<div class="row"><img class="img-responsive col-xs-12 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1 col-lg-10 col-lg-offset-1" src="img/hd6.jpg" alt="">\r\n                    </div>\r\n                    \r\n                    <span class="caption text-muted">Walnuts</span>\r\n<br>\r\n', 'Artika Singh', 'healthy.png', 'hd6.jpg');
