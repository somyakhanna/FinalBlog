Monuments are such testaments that speak volumes of bloodshed and sacrifices, rise and downfall of empires, advancement in generation and culture. They are the epitomes of modes of thoughts involved in the ancient era. Monuments in Delhi are one of those epic and unique history bearers that fascinate its sightseer unveiling humongous amounts of glory hidden within.

It is also called as "All India War Memorial" located astride Rajpath and its view is as that of an arch standing erect in all its glory. All along its stature, the gate bears the beautifully carved names of 82,000 soldiers who sacrificed their lives and the place whispers the aura of their gallantry. The tricolours of the Indian flag under the velvety sky illuminate the India Gate every evening and the sight alone makes it adorn the top position in the list of tourist sites in Delhi.\n</p>\n\n<h2 class="section-heading">Red Fort</h2>\n                    <div class="row"><img class="img-responsive col-xs-12 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1 col-lg-10 col-lg-offset-1" src="img/red.jpg" alt="">\n                    </div>\n                    \n                    <span class="caption text-muted ">Red Fort</span>\n<p>\nRed Fort is well known for its massive enclosing walls of red sandstone. Its architecture bellows the supremacy and royalty of Indo-Islamic and Mughal epoch. It nearly served for about 200 years as a main residence for the emperor of the Mughal dynasty and as the ceremonial and political centre of the Mughal state. The enormous building reflects a fusion of Timurid and Persian traditions. The Red Fort is the largest monument in Delhi and its importance is such that the Prime Minister of India hoists the tricoloured flag at the foremost entry of the fort. A sound and light show describing Mughal history is a tourist attraction in twilight and attracts thousands of individuals every year with its innovative architectural style.\n</p>\n\n<h2 class="section-heading">Qutub Minar</h2>\n  <div class="row"><img class="img-responsive col-xs-12 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1 col-lg-10 col-lg-offset-1" src="img/qutub.jpg" alt="">\n                    </div>\n                    \n                    <span class="caption text-muted ">Qutub Minar</span>\n<p>\nAdorning the top position as the world''s highest minaret, Qutub Minar throngs with tourists and visitors every day.

The Mosque is located at the foot of Qutub Minar that is a part of Qutub Complex, comprising of an iron pillar that is more than 2000 years old but still has not rusted.

So we ended up at Ambience, the vella roamer''s paradise if you are in Gurgaon.\r\n</P>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>\r\n"Let''s go to Bluo''s" one of us jumped & rest were like not again. Then we heard a group passing by with one mocking others about not knowing how to skate. Taking a hint we finally ended up for ice skating at iSKATE.\r\n</p>\r\n <div class="row"><img class="img-responsive col-xs-12 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1 col-lg-10 col-lg-offset-1" src="img/adven1.jpg" alt="">\r\n                    </div>\r\n                    </a>\r\n                    <span class="caption text-muted"> </span>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>\r\nBought our tickets & booked 4.00-5.15 pm slot. One of us was comfortable as she did it before, two had never done skating. I ,on the other hand, used to skate as a child, so was totally confused & excited at the same time. Our slot started, we went in. The amount of ice & the mesmerizing blue lightings all around somehow made us forget that we were in a hot city with an outside temperature of 42 degrees.\r\n</p>\r\n<div class="row"><img class="img-responsive col-xs-12 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1 col-lg-10 col-lg-offset-1" src="img/adven2.jpg" alt="">\r\n                    </div>\r\n                    </a>\r\n                    <span class="caption text-muted"> </span><br>\r\n<p>\r\nWe lined up, got our skates which looked totally different than my roller ones so took my friend''s help to put them on. People started getting on the ice covered floor and in an instant there was a train of people moving along the side railings. The expert ones started showing off their moves with a grin of superiority on their face. But I envied the children a little who had a personal penguin shaped support to skate along ,sob. \r\n</p>\r\n<br><div class="row"><img class="img-responsive col-xs-12 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1 col-lg-10 col-lg-offset-1" src="img/adven3.jpg" alt="">\r\n                    </div>\r\n                    </a>\r\n                    <span class="caption text-muted"> </span><br>\r\n<p>\r\nAnd then started the chain reaction of people falling, one here other there. Some slipping, some trying to support others and a few being victim of the falling ones in search of support. Tired of walking in the chain and after getting a little confident of the slipperiness, my childhood instincts kicked in and I decided to let go off the railing. Started with small movements, trying my best not to fall and yeah I completed my first round without any help. Cautious of not to have that same grin I went to my friends, caught hold of them & started skating in the middle, one slide at a time. And after two rounds out of nowhere we lost our balance & bam, our bums first kiss with the icy floor. It was chilling. I thanked I had pyjamas on as it was easier to get up rather than in a jeans.\r\n</p>\r\n<br><div class="row"><img class="img-responsive col-xs-12 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1 col-lg-10 col-lg-offset-1" src="img/adven4.jpg" alt="">\r\n                    </div> <br>\r\n                    </a>\r\n                    <span class="caption text-muted"> </span><br>\r\n<p>\r\nAll the guides were also helping people skate, getting them up & teaching the knitty grittys of skating. And finally I caught an unattended alone penguin, waiting to be grabbed. With a few minutes left we went for the last round, two of us hung on the penguin, with eyes wide open to take it all in.\r\nLater people lined up at the food & beverage outlet and the souvenir shop where one can choose from skates, international branded merchandise & iSKATE souvenirs. \r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<br><div class="row"><img class="img-responsive col-xs-12 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1 col-lg-10 col-lg-offset-1" src="img/adven5.jpg" alt="">\r\n                    </div>\r\n                    </a>\r\n                    <span class="caption text-muted"> </span><br>\r\n<p>\r\nNot wanting it to end or at least get two hours in the session, we left the place discussing our slides & slips, the icy cool floor & the smiles people had after this beautiful experience.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n', 'Chetna Dhull', 'skate.png', 'adven2.jpg'),

Alternatively, you can add it to your green tea or have it \r\nwith a mix of hot water and honey.\r\n<br><br>\r\nWhy Lemon?<br>\r\nOne lemon a day fulfills a person&#39;s 100 percent vitamin C needs. It has been speculated that they can prevent cancer by slowing the growth of certain cells.

Some interesting ways to include it in your meals are to cook it with rice, mixed vegetables or even as a pizza topping!\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy Broccoli?\r\n<br>\r\nIt is rich in Vitamin K, B1, B2, B6, B9, Amino Acid, Sodium, Potassium and is known to have more Vitamin E than olive oil.
